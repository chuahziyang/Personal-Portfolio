### Emob is a system created to track the status of servicemen as they go through the mob manning process. System admins will be able to mark servicemen status via a QR code as they progress through the relevant stations. Servicemen will have to complete all relevant stations and show their station status page as they leave the camp to ensure all stations have been completed
